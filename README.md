# LorisProject
This is my portfolio page to show a little of my personality and my coding skills, so far.  My features include CSS flexboxes and a lovely CSS animation.  I created a lot of 
gradients because I think they are fun but I don't think they count as a requirement.  I have a JavaScript array with code adding and taking out part of the original list. And I 
added a super fun JavaScript button.  I have two media queries - one which adjusts for tablets and one which adjusts for laptops. I think I added enough comments so you can
follow my actions.
